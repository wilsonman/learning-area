	<p>My favorite sport is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball" title="Wikipedia Article on Basketball" terget="_blank">basketball</a>. I like basketball because it has lots of high-flying blocks and dunks and the players score very quickly. My favorite play in basketball is the slam dunk. I like seeing players like Zion Williamson and Vince Carter do tricks like making a 360<span>&#176;</span> spins, tomahawks where the ball goes behind the player's back before thrusting, and the windmill,  where the dunker extends his arm and makes a helicopter-like move before slamming it in. My favorite defensive play is the block. My favorite block is <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dzXCT7Sy-s"title="Zion&#39s Monster Block Against UVA">when Zion swatted University of Virginia's De'Andre Hunter's 3 into the stands.</a></p>
	<p> In basketball, it only takes as much as 10 seconds before the game has a score, unlike in other sports where you can go as much as 5 or more minutes before someone scores the first points. This allows basketball to have the higest final scores in all of sports. This is also assisted by giving the offense only 24 seconds (or 14 seconds after an ofensive rebound) to take a shot, saving the sport from a huge protest because of players stalling the ball so much the defense has to foul.</p>
